![Introduction](assets/Readme-Introduction.png)

This was my first project, built step by step as I was following the process explained by the mentor. It looks very simple and clean for now, but since I still have a long journey ahead, I think it is a good starting point. I can always come back later to apply more features to this when I learn more of it.

As my first project, I really enjoyed the feeling of watching what I was buiding, code by code, and as a simple project but with great potential, I could realize how many other things I will make in the future.
